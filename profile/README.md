# Team 17 – Machine Learning Classification of Structural Dynamics  

Welcome to the GitHub organization for **Team 17** of Liberty University’s School of Engineering Senior Capstone Project (2025–2026).  
This repository space houses all source code, documentation, and resources related to our work with **Framatome, Inc.** on the project:  

> **Machine Learning Classification of Structural Dynamics**

## 📖 Project Overview  
Inside nuclear reactors, the **core barrel** and its supporting bolts experience vibration-induced stresses that can lead to degradation.  
Our project focuses on a **scale model** and a **Digital Twin (ANSYS model)** to study these vibrations.  

The goals of this year’s work are to:  
1. **Finalize calibration** of the ANSYS Digital Twin with the experimental scale model.  
2. **Develop a machine learning pipeline** that classifies vibration signals corresponding to different structural degradation states.  

This project blends **modal analysis, signal processing, finite element analysis, and machine learning** into a unified framework.
